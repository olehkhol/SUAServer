# Secure User Authentication | Ktor Server

This repository contains the server-side implementation developed using Ktor as part of the "[Secure User Authentication | Android + Ktor Server + MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/secure-user-authentication-android-ktor-server-mongodb/)" course by [Stefan Jovanovic](https://www.udemy.com/user/432ccf97-0b71-49ed-bb6f-2fe606116148/). The server securely manages user information and authentication processes with MongoDB as the database.
